SELECT "rowid" as rowid,* FROM  "albums" ORDER BY 1 LIMIT 300 OFFSET 0;

-- 2020-03-16 11:44:52.1300
SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM  "albums";

-- 2020-03-16 12:08:45.7820
SELECT *

-- 2020-03-16 12:12:12.4560
SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM  "albums";

-- 2020-03-16 12:12:23.8590
SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM  "albums";

-- 2020-03-16 12:12:51.6040
SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM  "albums";

these were in my sql table reader when I opened it so I figured I would include it here.
